          It takes above average resilience and resolve to overcome the
          challenges standing between you and your dreams, and Toronto-based hip
          hop artist, Kalan Cox, clearly has both qualities in abundance.
          “There’s so much negativity in the world. We need more positivity.
          Everybody goes through different things and has personal struggles,
          but you just have to keep moving forward.”
          <br></br>
          That work ethic has
          prompted everything the 15-year-old recording artist has taken on over
          time as a songwriter, wordsmith and dancer, and something he hopes to
          inspire others to adopt themselves to meet any challenges they may
          face.
          <br></br>
          Case in point: In 2017 Kalan snapped his arm at the elbow while
          doing a flip. It was a serious break, resulting in his wrist being
          immobilized for six months and potentially permanent nerve damage.
          But, true to form, Kalan continued to dance, while wearing a cast, and
          ultimately recovered.
          <br></br>
          Kalan channels that same variety of defiance and
          resolve in a pair of eminently hook centric hard-hitting tunes ‘Can’t
          Tell Me’ and New World – recorded last summer. 
          <br></br>
          In each song, the
          message is simple, but compelling; that any challenge is best met head
          up and straight on. That’s the approach Kalan has taken throughout his
          life artistically and personally. At age five he got into dance by
          emulating Michael Jackson so well that anyone who saw him dance knew
          instantly he’d go on to master some serious moves. Barely a year
          later, when his mother lost her battle with breast cancer, he began
          approaching music and dance with a dedication well beyond his years,
          throwing himself into both disciplines heart and soul as a means of
          moving forward. 
          <br></br>
          Over time Kalan continued to hone his moves and
          perform in dance battles and performances across Canada, including the
          2018 Breakin’ Convention at Toronto’s Sony Center. 
          <br></br>
          Kalan has developed
          a signature style defined by blazingly fast wordplay, fluid tempo
          changes and inspirational raps that challenge his listeners to stand
          up for themselves and do whatever they need to do in order to fulfill
          their own potential, regardless of what anyone else thinks. 
          <br></br>
          At the
          core of ‘New World’, a song in which Kalan envisions a world without
          hate and without people judging other people – a world he believes can
          exist in the here and now if people work for it and put their
          differences aside – as he puts it: ‘no more waiting, no more hating,
          no debating, we gotta start relating’. 
          <br></br>
          Kalan has two new songs coming
          out this summer “Chosen” - high energy and fast moving and “Zoom” a
          melodic fun uplifting tune.
